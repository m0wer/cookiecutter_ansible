A brief description of the project goes here.

## Compatibility

Compatible GNU/Linux distributions and version. On which distros is it tested?

## Requirements

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the project

may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is
required.

including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any

vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.
